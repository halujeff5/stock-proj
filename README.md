# Stock Dashboard for ValueGlance

### Welcome to my dashboard! Please have a look around! About 3.5 days was spent creating this dashboard. ðŸ“ˆ ApexCharts was used for the charts you see on dashboard and Finnhub.io for the data. Please view dashboard [here](https://cerulean-bavarois-100eab.netlify.app/). The table shows the latest 5 stock values.

### Additional features: 
* real time chart for stock - using ApexCharts and websockets, if the x-axis has equal timestamps, data will not plot.
* user input text field - this allows user to input aymbola to view different stocks
* loading state - loading states when the chart and table is loaded

### This project was fun and it was my first time using technologies such as Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts, and websockets. Thanks!
