# Stock Dashboard for ValueGlance

### Welcome to my dashboard! Please have a look around! 📈 ApexCharts was used for the charts you see on dashboard and Finnhub.io for the data. 

### Additional features: 
* real time charts for DJIA, NASDAQ, S&P500, RUSSELL2000 📆
* user input text field
* loading state
* error handling ❌ for a mis-entered stock symbol 

### This project was fun and it was my first time using technologies such as Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts, and websockets.
