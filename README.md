# Stock Dashboard for ValueGlance

### Welcome to my dashboard! Please have a look around! About 3.5 days was spent creating this dashboard. ðŸ“ˆ ApexCharts was used for the charts you see on dashboard and Finnhub.io for the data. Please view dashboard [here](https://68adde4982a5c836160e2aeb--cerulean-bavarois-100eab.netlify.app/).

### Additional features: 
* real time chart for stock 
* user input text field
* loading state 

### This project was fun and it was my first time using technologies such as Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts, and websockets. I've found if the timestamp of the websocket stream has the same time, the chart does not render until that timestamp is gone from queue. Thanks!
