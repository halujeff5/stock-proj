# Stock Dashboard

### Welcome to my dashboard! Please have a look around! About 3.5 days was spent creating this dashboard. ðŸ“ˆ ApexCharts was used for the charts you see on dashboard and Finnhub.io for the data. Please view dashboard deployed via Netlify [here](https://cerulean-bavarois-100eab.netlify.app/). The table shows the latest 5 stock values. Because it is a websocket with streaming data, the dashboard will only work during market hours. Sorry for inconvenience.

### Additional features: 
* real time chart for stock - using ApexCharts and websockets, if the x-axis has equal timestamps, data will not plot.
* user input text field - this allows user to input stock symbols to view different stocks
* loading state - loading states when the chart and table is loading

### This project was fun and it was my first time using technologies such as Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts, and websockets. Thanks!
