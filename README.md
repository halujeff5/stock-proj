# Stock Dashboard for ValueGlance

### Welcome to my dashboard! Please have a look around! About 3 days was spent creating this dashboard. 📈 ApexCharts was used for the charts you see on dashboard and Finnhub.io for the data. 

### Additional features: 
* real time charts for DJIA, NASDAQ, S&P500, RUSSELL2000 📆
* user input text field
* loading state
* error handling ❌ for a mis-entered stock symbol 

### This project was fun and it was my first time using technologies such as Tailwind CSS, ApexCharts, and websockets. Please reach out to me about this intriguing internship opportunity! Thank you.
